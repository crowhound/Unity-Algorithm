# Algorithms for Unity Developers.

## Description
This repo will contain different algorithms and examples that can be used for Unity and any .Net project in general.

Examples include things like Graham Scan to create outlines of out different sets of points. One example shows how to pass in a collection of tiles 
and let Graham Scan calculate an outline to render a visual without needing shaders.

## Wiki
I will be adding a Wiki with videos, and explanations about each one to help show how they work.
Please reuqest new stuff to be added either by making a issue on the repo with the request label or by going to the Discord I have linked on my profile for longer dicussions.
